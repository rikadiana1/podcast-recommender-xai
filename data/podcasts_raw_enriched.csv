The Diddy Diaries,Bobby Capucci,en,en,en,,en,"Commentary, News, True Crime","['Commentary', 'News', 'True Crime']",Commentary,"The Diddy Diaries: The Downfall of Sean Combs is a raw, unflinching look at the dramatic collapse of one of hip-hop’s biggest moguls. For decades, Sean 'Diddy' Combs seemed untouchable—a figure who rose from the streets to become a titan of the music, fashion, and entertainment industries. His Bad Boy Entertainment label defined a generation of hip-hop, and his entrepreneurial spirit made him a household name. But beneath the surface of this glittering success lay darker currents—currents that have now surged into the spotlight as the empire he built threatens to crumble beneath the weight of scandal and serious criminal allegations.<br /><br />This podcast dives deep into the allegations that have sent shockwaves through the entertainment world. At the center of it all are the accusers—those who have come forward with shocking claims of misconduct, manipulation, and abuse. These aren’t just sensational headlines—they are stories that expose a side of Sean Combs the public never saw. The Diddy Diaries explores how these accusations began to surface, what drove his accusers to finally speak out, and how the legal system has responded.<br /><br />But this isn’t just about Diddy’s public image taking a hit—The Diddy Diaries zeroes in on the high-stakes battle that Diddy now faces to stay out of jail. Each episode unpacks the legal drama as it unfolds in real-time: the charges, the court proceedings, and the fight for his freedom. Once a man who had it all—fame, fortune, and influence—Diddy now stands at the center of a legal storm that threatens to strip him of everything, including his freedom.<br /><br /><br />We trace the events that led up to this moment, looking at how Diddy’s larger-than-life persona masked a pattern of behavior that would ultimately bring him to this point. Listeners will get a front-row seat to the high-stakes legal battles, where the possibility of incarceration looms large. The tension is palpable as Diddy’s legal team works to combat the mounting evidence against him, while his accusers push for justice.<br /><br />Through riveting storytelling, The Diddy Diaries paints a full picture of Diddy’s downfall, from the heights of his stardom to the depths of his legal fight for survival. This is not a story about maintaining power or influence—it’s a fight to avoid the ultimate consequence: prison. As the allegations mount and the legal drama intensifies, The Diddy Diaries delivers a compelling narrative of a man grappling with the very real possibility of losing everything he once held dear.<br /><br />With every episode, listeners are drawn deeper into this unfolding saga of celebrity, power, and justice. The Diddy Diaries not only explores the high-profile case but also delves into the human cost behind the headlines. As Diddy’s world unravels, so too does the carefully constructed image he spent decades building. This podcast is a must-listen for anyone who wants to understand the full scope of Sean Combs’ downfall, where the stakes couldn’t be higher and the outcome remains uncertain.<br /><br />Prepare for a rollercoaster ride through the most shocking and consequential scandal in recent entertainment history. Tune in to The Diddy Diaries: The Downfall of Sean Combs to witness the dramatic fall of a man who once ruled the music world but now fights for his freedom in the face of life-altering allegations.<br />",https://www.spreaker.com/show/5976627/episodes/feed,1712188502.0,1000.0,0,0,,,

What started as a journalist covering local crime stories turned into an obsession that cost me sleep, relationships, and nearly my sanity.<br /><br />But it also led to something incredible: 3 cold cases reopened, 2 killers caught, and 1 innocent man freed.<br /><br /><b>Whispers of Crime</b> isn't just another true crime podcast. It's where forgotten victims finally get their voices heard and families get the answers they've waited decades for.<br /><br />Every week, I take you inside cases that will make your blood run cold:<br /><ul><li>Serial killers who are still walking free (including one who lives closer to you than you think)</li><li>Murder cases the police ""closed"" but never solved</li><li>Missing people whose disappearances hide shocking family secrets</li><li>DNA breakthroughs that are changing everything we thought we knew</li></ul>I don't just tell you what happened. I show you the crime scene photos, play you the 911 calls, and take you inside the interrogation rooms where killers finally break down and confess sometimes.<br /><br />Warning: These aren't bedtime stories. Last week, a listener called to say my episode on the ""Playground Killer"" made her check on her daughter three times that night. Another wrote to tell me she solved a 15-year-old missing person case in her hometown after hearing my tips on spotting patterns.<br /><br />The victims trusted the wrong person. The families trusted the wrong system. The killers thought they got away with it.<br /><br />They were all wrong.<br /><br />If you can handle the truth about what people are really capable of, hit play.

Daf Yomi: The 35 minute Daf,Daf Yomi,en,en,en,,en,"Education, Judaism, Language, Learning, Religion, Spirituality","['Education', 'Judaism', 'Language', 'Learning', 'Religion', 'Spirituality']",Education,"I have been teaching the Daf for nearly 40 years. I get up at 3:30 am to prep and share the Shiur at 5:30.
The Shiur keeps things short and simple and you can expect to also learn more about real-life learnings from the Talmud (with some baseball knowledge as well).
If you are just starting the Daf or thinking of joining, I highly recommend you spend 2 minutes reading below.
Initiated by Rav Meir Shapiro back in 1923, the completion of each cycle has included more and more participants every cycle, so that today perhaps 100,000 or more Jews around the world have actually studied all 2,711 Dapim during this cycle.  This milestone is truly remarkable in the annals of world projects.  It is a tribute to Rav Shapiro that his initiative has continued to grow almost a century after it began.  Being involved with Daf Hayomi for over forty years myself, here are some of my observations regarding this important and life-changing project:
1. Anyone can partake, scholar or otherwise. No background education is necessary to study Torah. 
2. Don’t be reticent to start out of fear of not being able to commit to completing 7 and ½ years of Cycle 14, beginning this coming Sunday.  Even studying one day is better than not at all. Even coming late to a shiur is worthwhile; you can learn something from every line of the Talmud. 
3. There is no need to start at the beginning of a tractate.  Any day that you study, either online, in person, on the phone, or on your own with a translated Talmud, you will derive spiritual and intellectual benefit. 
4. Rav Sabato explains that the Daf Hayomi has three great qualities: completion - if you can make it through 7.5 years; regularity - you are forced to do something every day; and partnership – the great feeling of partaking in project together with tens of thousands of others.  
5. It is important to study the current day’s Daf on that day, because the Siyata Dishmaya, Heavenly aid, for multitudes is greater than for the individual, just as prayer in a quorum of ten brings the Shchina (Heavenly Countenance) to us. If you fall behind, still try to learn the scheduled day’s Daf on that day.
6. Some feel that a Daf per day is too fast and superficial to absorb all intricacies of the Talmud, and they are better off studying the Talmud more slowly and in greater depth.  But will they be studying every day with the same drive that the Daf Hayomi forces upon us, with no breaks for Shabbat, fast days, weddings, Bar Mitzvah’s, and other commitments that take up our time?  
7. Someone once boasted to a rabbi that he had gone through the entire Shas. The rabbi replied, “but has Shas gone through you?” Try to apply something you learn each day into your practical daily life.
8. Don’t be discouraged if you can’t keep it up or can’t attend each day.  Do your best, and you will gain from every word you absorb.  Think of this:  if you don’t do Daf Hayomi, how will you be spending your time instead?  You will never regret studying Daf Hayomi, but you may regret not trying.  
9. Do this for yourself, not to gain approbation or appreciation from others. Then you will never be disappointed. 
10. I can be reached at ephraim.schreibman@gmail.com. Good luck and happy learning!",https://feeds.captivate.fm/the-35-minute-daf-yomi/,1527880815.0,2000.0,0,0,,,

The illegal activities at the facility led to its closing and listing as an EPA superfund site in late 1991. For his efforts at exposing the wrongdoing Steven was rewarded by Aqua tech with lung fulls of hydrogen chloride gas which left him permanently injured.
He did not speak publicly again about these events until 2017 in an interview with Richard Kary on Truth Cat Radio.

Since then, Steven has been a commentator on independent media on Revision Media and most recently on RBN’s Beyond the Official Narrative with Richard Kary.

On Thought Crime Live we discuss the current state of clown world civilization where independent thought will soon be considered an act of terrorism.

Thuis of onderweg luisteren naar de Bijbel en de uitleg er van was nog nooit zo eenvoudig. Deze podcast wordt je aangeboden door Geloofstoerusting.nl

Geloofstoerusting is in 2012 opgericht door Maarten Baan en Marcel Vroegop met als doel om jongeren toe te rusten om God te verheerlijken, Jezus te volgen en elkaar te dienen. Bij Geloofstoerusting kunnen christenen terecht voor verdiepende artikelen, preken, boeken, video’s en andere Bijbelgetrouwe materialen. Veel materialen zijn vertaald vanuit het Engels, maar er raken ook steeds meer Nederlandse predikanten en sprekers betrokken bij de bediening van Geloofstoerusting. 

Van een digitaal platform is Geloofstoerusting in de afgelopen jaren uitgegroeid tot een beweging die jongeren en ouderen verenigt in hun verlangen om God te dienen en op diverse plaatsen in het land activiteiten organiseert. Het is een vreugde om te zien hoe God het werk van Geloofstoerusting gebruikt om de onwankelbare vreugde en de rijkdom van Zijn genade uit te delen aan jongeren én ouderen. Soli Deo Gloria!

<p>Over 8 million downloads because we answer the questions that matter: How do I build mental strength? What creates lasting motivation? How can I understand my own mind well enough to work with it, not against it?</p>
<p>This podcast is for curious skeptics who want frameworks backed by psychology studies, not Instagram quotes. Whether you're navigating procrastination, building self-discipline, or designing your own philosophy for a life well lived—we explore the hidden psychology behind real change.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL GET</strong></p>
<p>Mental models and simple techniques from cognitive psychology, positive psychology, and ancient wisdom traditions like Stoicism and Buddhism.</p>
<p>Being a human can be confusing, learning about it doesn’t have to be.</p>
<p>We cover everything from emotional intelligence and habit formation to brain health and the nervous system.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU DON’T GET</strong></p>
<p>No pseudoscience. No oversimplified ""hacks."" No hustle porn.</p>
<p>Just practical insights on mindset improvement, self-development, and human psychology that respect your intelligence and mental health.</p>
<p><strong>THE APPROACH</strong></p>
<p>Instead of telling you what to think, we explore how thinking works. Armed with psychology studies, social science research, and relentless curiosity, we uncover the mechanics of belief change, attitude change, and personal development.</p>
<p>Success is personal. You might want to leverage your neurodiverse strengths, build a business, or simply discover how to be happier. We provide the mental frameworks to pursue your definition of success with mental strength and self-care that fits your life.</p>
<p><strong>YOUR HOST</strong></p>
<p>I'm Sam Webster Harris—a lifelong learner with ADHD and an obsession with finding answers to hard questions. After launching businesses, traveling the world, and nearly dying a few times, I concluded that psychology and science are where real wisdom lives.</p>
<p>This show is my excuse to dive deep into health and fitness research, behavioral psychology, and cool science while helping you build genuine self-discipline and motivation.</p>

In deze BNR- podcast geven advocaten en officieren van justitie voor het eerst een unieke inkijk in geruchtmakende strafprocessen.
De podcast bestaat sinds het najaar van 2021 en wist vorig jaar als winnaar uit de bus te komen bij de Dutch Podcast Awards in de categorie crime. In iedere aflevering staat één strafproces centraal waarbij Laumans en Flokstra hun gast kritisch ondervragen en op die manier de zaak tot op de bodem analyseren.
In Napleiten hoor je de ene week alles over aan wietplantages gerelateerde ripdeals. In andere afleveringen word je meegenomen naar een crime passionel óf een ex-TBS-er die opnieuw in de fout gaat. Ook wordt regelmatig teruggekeken op gebeurtenissen die heel Nederland nog helder voor de geest staan. Denk aan de schietpartij in het winkelcentrum in Alphen a/d Rijn of de Damschreeuwer. Napleiten beperkt zich bovendien niet tot alleen maar strafprocessen in Nederland. Ook buiten onze landsgrenzen zijn immers volop interessante zaken te vinden!
Napleiten: wekelijks op BNR Nieuwsradio op zaterdag van 10.00-11.00 uur. Daarnaast zijn ook alle voorgaande afleveringen van de podcast beschikbaar op het BNR-platform of andere bekende podcastplatforms. Napleiten is in november 2023 uitgeroepen tot de Beste Podcast van Nederland.
Over de makers:
Wouter Laumans is misdaadjournalist bij Het Parool. Je kent hem waarschijnlijk als auteur van de bestseller ‘Mocro Maffia’ uit 2014. In 2019 verscheen het vervolg op dit boek: ‘Wraak’. In het verleden schreef Laumans voor NRC, Panorama en Nieuwe Revu.
Christian Flokstra is in 2008 in de advocatuur begonnen nadat hij eerst een jaar als docent en onderzoeker aan de Vrije Universiteit verbonden was. Flokstra was als strafrechtadvocaat onder meer betrokken bij grote strafzaken tegen de georganiseerde misdaad, zoals Passage, Marengo en Eris.
Ayse Çimen begon haar carrière in 2008 bij Spong Advocaten, waar ze zich heeft gespecialiseerd in het strafrecht. Sinds 2017 is Ayse partner bij Takens Admiraal Advocaten te Amsterdam. De praktijk van Çimen bestaat o.a. uit georganiseerde misdaad, witwaszaken, drugshandel, overvallen, inbraken, diefstal, moord, doodslag en overige geweldsdelicten. Op dit moment verdedigt Ayse één van de verdachten van de moord op Peter R. de Vries.",https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/8257a063-6be9-42fa-b892-acd4013b1255/90df5b0c-5e99-4080-be99-b06c008edeb8/63b9b779-5f8d-4a2d-83ab-b06c008edee2/podcast.rss,1591011702.0,175.0,0,0,,,

The Carl Jackson Podcast,Salem Podcast Network,en-US,en-US,en,,en,News,['News'],News,"Carl Jackson was born and raised in Los Angeles, California by his mother and father until the age of 11 when his mother died unexpectedly of a chronic illness. Carl attempted to find his way as the youngest of six who were lost without the strength of their matriarch. He moved back and forth between L.A and Orlando, FL trying to find his way in life. With the help of family and friends he was introduced to hard work, faith, and family values. However, as a struggling teen he wandered down the path of least resistance, finding himself in jail twice and with a child he had to fight to raise.
By the grace of God and insistence by his brother and friend he attended an evangelical church and found that there was a better way. Once he accepted Jesus Christ as his savior, he began to develop a greater desire to understand who God is and why it mattered. He began to see that the cultural dependence on government promoted by the Democrat leaders among his community rejected dependence upon God. As he studied America’s history, he discovered that despite America’s flaws, particularly slavery, God used our Founding Fathers to create our Constitution within the context of the Bible and world history. Its divine and exceptional nature is undeniable.
It was during his newfound love for American history that he discovered the Democrat party perpetuated slavery, formed the KKK, and fought against the civil rights of minorities. With this hidden history Carl was launched on a journey to help people of all races and backgrounds discover facts of history as well as realize the benefits of utilizing their God-given gifts and talents far outweigh any benefit from a government subsidy.",https://www.omnycontent.com/d/playlist/5e27a451-e6e6-4c51-aa03-a7370003783c/f83d9643-126d-4f03-bc7d-ae240172a389/01f6174d-4d2d-4b32-b7c8-ae240172d590/podcast.rss,1502474233.0,902.0,0,0,,,
